Comparative Study of Causal Discovery Methods: Neural Network-Based Algorithms vs. Functional Models (LiNGAM, RESIT)

This repository contains the source code and experiment setup for a Bachelor thesis focused on evaluating and comparing neural network-based causal discovery methods with traditional functional models such as LiNGAM. The primary dataset involves sensor and process data from CNC machines, with the goal of learning causal relationships between features and predicting average power consumption.

Methods Compared
Neural Network-Based Models:
Causal Neural Network Model (custom deep causal learning architecture)

Functional Models:
LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model)
